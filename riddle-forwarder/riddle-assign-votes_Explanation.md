## Vulnerability and Takeaways

The vulnerability in this code lies in the `AssignVotes` contract's ability to assign votes to any address, including the attacker's contract. The `MaliciousContract` contract takes advantage of this by creating a proposal and then creating two instances of `ProposalVoterCreator` contracts to create voters to vote on the proposal. Each `ProposalVoterCreator` contract creates five `Voter` contracts and assigns each of them to vote on the proposal. Since the attacker controls the `ProposalVoterCreator` contract, they can assign the voters to vote for their proposal, effectively controlling the outcome of the proposal.

One possible solution to prevent the exploit in this code would be to implement stricter access control mechanisms, such as only allowing certain trusted addresses to assign votes. This would prevent any unauthorized actors from assigning votes and manipulating the outcome of proposals.
